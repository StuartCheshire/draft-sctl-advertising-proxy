      DNS-Based Service Discovery
      <xref target="RFC6763"/>
      <xref target="I-D.cheshire-dnssd-roadmap"/>
      was designed to facilitate Zero Configuration IP Networking
      <xref target="RFC6760"/>
      <xref target="ZC"/>.<br/>

      When used with Multicast DNS
      <xref target="RFC6762"/>
      with ".local" domain names
      <xref target="RFC6761"/>
      this works well on a single link (a single broadcast domain).
      </t>

      <t>
      There is also a desire to have
      DNS-Based Service Discovery
      work between multiple links
      that aren't part of the same broadcast domain
      <xref target="RFC7558"/>.
      Even within a single Wi&nbhy;Fi broadcast domain
      it is beneficial to reduce multicast traffic,
      because, in comparison to Wi&nbhy;Fi unicast traffic,
      Wi&nbhy;Fi multicast is inefficient, slow, and unreliable
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-mboned-ieee802-mcast-problems"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
      There are three variant ways that this move
      to greater use of unicast is achieved.
      </t>

      <t>
      One variant is pure end-to-end unicast,
      with services
      using unicast Service Registration Protocol
      <xref target="I-D.sctl-service-registration"/>
      to register with a service registry,
      and clients
      using unicast DNS Push Notifications
      <xref target="RFC8765"/>
      over DNS Stateful Operations
      <xref target="RFC8490"/>
      to communicate with the service registry
      to discover and track changes
      to those registered services.
      </t>
      <t>
      A second variant is a hybrid approach
      that facilitates legacy devices
      that only implement link-local Multicast DNS
      (like your ten-year-old network laser printer)
      having their services discovered by remote clients,
      using a unicast DNS Push Notifications session
      to a Discovery Proxy
      <xref target="RFC8766"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
      The third variant, documented here,
      is a logical complement to the second variant.
      It enables legacy clients
      (that only implement link-local Multicast DNS)
      to discover services registered (using unicast)
      with a service registry.
      The service registry accepts service registrations
      using unicast Service Registration Protocol
      <xref target="I-D.sctl-service-registration"/>,
      and makes those service registrations visible,
      both to remote clients using unicast DNS Push Notifications
      <xref target="RFC8765"/>
      and, using the Advertising Proxy mechanism documented here,
      to local clients using Multicast DNS
      <xref target="RFC6762"/>.

      <name>Advertising Proxy</name>

      <t>
      An Advertising Proxy can be
      a component of any DNS authoritative server,
      though it logically makes most sense as a component of
      a service registry
      (a DNS authoritative server that implements
      Service Registration Protocol
      <xref target="I-D.sctl-service-registration"/>).
      A client can send registration requests
      for any valid DNS records to a service registry,
      though in practice the most common use is to
      register the PTR, SRV and TXT records that
      describe a DNS-SD service
      <xref target="RFC6763"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
      When a service registry accepts
      a registration request for DNS records,
      a service registry that implements an Advertising Proxy
      also advertises equivalent records
      using Multicast DNS on one or more configured local
      multicast-capable interfaces.
      An Advertising Proxy could also advertise
      on one or more configured remote multicast-capable interfaces
      using a Multicast DNS Relay
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-mdns-relay"/>.
      For the purposes of this document,
      a local multicast-capable interface directly attached to the host
      and
      a remote multicast-capable interface connected via a relay
      are considered to be equivalent.
      </t>

      <section numbered="true">
        <name>Name Conflicts</name>
        <t>
        In the event that an SRP client attempts to register
        a record with a name that was already created in that
        registry by a different SRP client, 
        or is otherwise disallowed by policy,
        a name conflict is reported and the new
        client is required to choose a new name.
        </t>

        <t>
        Similarly, Multicast DNS implements
        first-come-first-served name allocation.
        When a registered record is advertised using
        Multicast DNS it may suffer a name conflict if a
        different Multicast DNS record with that name
        already exists on that link.
        In the case of network failures, Multicast DNS
        can also signal name conflicts at a later time
        during the life of a record registration.
        For example, if the network link is partitioned at the
        time of record registration, the name conflict may not
        be discovered until later when the partition is healed.
        </t>

        <t>
        Specifically, a name conflict can occur:
        </t>

        <ol>
        <li>During the SRP validation process, because
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        another SRP client has already registered the same name.</li>
        <li>Immediately while the Advertising Proxy
        is registering the name.</li>
        <li><t>After the name has been successfully registered,
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        but before the response has been sent to the client.</t></li>
        <li>After the initial response has been sent to the client.</li>
        </ol>

        <t>
        In the first three cases, the client can be notified
        of the conflict at the time of registration,
        and is expected to choose a new name.
        In the last case, SRP clients must be coded defensively
        to handle the case where an apparently successful
        record registration is later determined to be in conflict,
        just as existing Multicast DNS clients have to be
        coded defensively to handle late conflicts gracefully.
        With a sleepy SRP client there may be no way to
        notify it of the conflict until it next re-registers.
        In this case, the service registry with Advertising Proxy
        capability is responsible for selecting a new name.
        The service registry sends the client
        the name it chose when it next renews.
        </t>

        <t>
        The registration process has several steps.
        First the hostname claimed by the SRP client must be registered.
        Once this has succeeded, the Advertising Proxy can register
        all of the service instances that point to that hostname.
        When all of these registrations have succeeded, the
        service registry can finally send its response to the SRP client.
        If any of them fail,
        they must all be removed and the client notified of the failure.
        If the failure is a result of a name conflict, the response
        code should be YXDOMAIN. Other SRP failures are documented
        in the SRP specification. Any other failure returns SERVFAIL.

        <name>Data Translation</name>
        <t>
        As with a Discovery Proxy
        <xref target="RFC8766"/>
        some translation needs to be performed before the
        Advertising Proxy makes the registered unicast data
        visible using Multicast DNS.
        Specifically, 
        the unicast DNS domain name suffix configured
        for Advertising Proxy use
        is stripped off and replaced
        with the top-level label "local".

        <name>No Text-Encoding Translation</name>

        <t>
        As with a Discovery Proxy
        <xref target="RFC8766"/>,
        an Advertising Proxy does no translation between
        text encodings
        <xref target="RFC6055"/>.
        Specifically, an Advertising Proxy does no
        translation between Punycode encoding
        <xref target="RFC3492"/>
        and UTF-8 encoding
        <xref target="RFC3629"/>,
        either in the owner name of DNS records or
        anywhere in the RDATA of DNS records
        (such as the RDATA of PTR records, SRV records, NS
        records, or other record types like TXT, where it is
        ambiguous whether the RDATA may contain DNS names).
        All bytes are treated as-is with no attempt at
        text-encoding translation.
        A server implementing DNS-based Service Discovery
        <xref target="RFC6763"/>
        will use UTF-8 encoding for its unicast DNS-based
        record registrations, which the Advertising Proxy
        passes through without any text-encoding
        translation to the Multicast DNS subsystem.
        Queries from peers on the configured multicast-capable
        interface are answered directly from the advertised data
        without any text-encoding translation.

        <name>No Address Suppression</name>
        <t>
        Unlike a Discovery Proxy
        <xref target="RFC8766"/>,
        an Advertising Proxy does not need to selectively suppress
        link-local
        <xref target="RFC3927"/>
        <xref target="RFC4862"/>
        or other addresses.
        Since the clients of the service registry are registering
        their records in a unicast DNS namespace, there is a presumption
        they they will only register addresses with sufficient scope
        to be usable by the anticipated clients.
        No further filtering or suppression
        by the service registry is required.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section numbered="true">
        <name>No Support for Reconfirm</name>
        <t>
        For network efficiency,
        Multicast DNS
        <xref target="RFC6762"/>
        uses fairly long record lifetimes
        (typically 75 minutes).
        When a client is unable to reach
        a service that it discovered,
        Multicast DNS provides a "reconfirm"
        mechanism that enables the client
        to signal to the Multicast DNS subsystem
        that its cached data may be suspect,
        which causes the Multicast DNS subsystem
        to reissue queries, and remove the stale
        records if the queries are not answered.
        </t>
        <t>
        Similarly, when using unicast service discovery
        with a Discovery Proxy <xref target="RFC8766"/>,
        the DNS Push Notifications <xref target="RFC8765"/> protocol
        provides the RECONFIRM mechanism to signal that
        the Discovery Proxy should perform a local
        Multicast DNS reconfirm operation to
        re-verify the validity of the records.
        </t>
        <t>
        When an Advertising Proxy is used,
        to support legacy clients that only implement Multicast DNS,
        reconfirm operations have no effect.

        If a device uses unicast Service Registration Protocol
        <xref target="I-D.sctl-service-registration"/>
        to register its services
        with a service registry with Advertising Proxy capability,
        and the device then gets disconnected from the network,
        the Advertising Proxy will continue to advertise
        those records until the registrations expire.

        If a client discovers the service instance using
        Multicast DNS and is unable to reach it,
        and uses a Multicast DNS reconfirm operation to re-verify
        the validity of the records, then
        the Advertising Proxy will continue
        to answer on behalf of the departed device
        until the record registrations expire.

        The Advertising Proxy has no reliable way
        to determine whether the additional Multicast DNS
        queries are due to a reconfirm operation,
        or due to other routine causes,
        like a client being rebooted,
        or disconnecting and then reconnecting to the network.

        The service registry has no reliable automatic way
        to determine whether a device that
        registered records has failed or disconnected from the network.
        Particularly with sleepy battery powered devices,
        the service registry does not know what active duty cycle
        any given service is expected to provide.
        </t>
        <t>
        Consequently, reconfirm operations are not supported
        with an Advertising Proxy.
        In cases where use of the reconfirm mechanism
        is important, clients should be upgraded to use the unicast
        DNS Push Notifications <xref target="RFC8765"/> protocol's
        RECONFIRM message.
        This RECONFIRM message provides an unambiguous signal
        to the service registry that it may be retaining stale records.
        (A future update to the Service Registration Protocol document
        <xref target="I-D.sctl-service-registration"/>
        will consider ways that this unambiguous signal
        can be used to trigger expedited removal of stale data.)
